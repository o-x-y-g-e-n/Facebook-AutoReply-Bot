# Facebook-AutoReply-Bot
Are you running a business and want to respond all new messages one at a time. Are you bored of sending messages to each and every client individually.


This Script replies to all new messages one at a time. Respond to all messages in one single click,

# Requirements
1) Node Version 8.x ( Get it here --> https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 
2) facebook-chat-api

# How to make this work
1) Go to the config folder and open the default.json file in notepad
2) Enter your Facebook Credentials there
3) Enter the message you want to reply. For the data part ... ( Use '\n' for new line and '$name' to get sender name)
4)-> Now Run 'script-win.exe' if windows.
-> Run 'script-macos' for mac.
-> Run 'script-linux' if linux.
5) Tada, It will reply to all new messages and then quit.

# Some Points to note:
I have made 2 similar programs for you.. Or both files will help you.

1)new-win.exe
-> It will check for any new messages. If there then it will reply them and quit.

2) script-repeat-win.exe
-> It will run every 10 minutes ... and check for any new messages and reply them if any. 

-----

Care has been taken so that it replies to messages already sitting there in bold. It will reply them too.

So Inshort,
1) If you want to reply to all new messages once, run new-win.exe (RECOMMENDED)
2) if you want to monitor continously, run script-repeat-win.exe (NOT RECOMMENDED)

---------
Facebook has become very script about any third party software accessing your account ( Because of the data lick that happened recently). So i suggest you to run new-win.exe manually each day.
--------------------------
NOTE:
1) Make sure you don't read any new messages.
2) New messages once read will not be replied. i.e only bold new messages will be replied.
3) It is recommended not to be online while running the script. Please logout from the PC.
